## Today's theme

-   Keep working together on Pathways
-   Learn a little about "agile" methodologies
-   Learn about GitHub project boards
-   co-work

## What is agile?

A **lightweight** workflow **structure** for software development which is characterized by 4 key features.  

Today agile methodologies are the norm in software development, and are widely used for other types of project management.

Term is traced back to the 2001 [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/), but the ideas are much earlier and broader.


## 4 elements

## Task cycles

A key element of agile methodologies is iterative cycles

This was popularized by the work of William Edwards Deming.

## Experiential learning

In "experiential learning" (David A Kolb, 1970s-1980s), the activity is the teacher via explicit periods of reflection and experimentation.

## Self-organizing workflows

A workflow or structure that naturally and organically improves team (or project) flow and efficiency.

### Task boards
- visualize your workflow
- team awareness
- encourages cycles of work

### Facetime
- short frequent synchronous check-ins, aka "stand-ups"
- co-working, group or often paired

## Task boards

<!--
## Why use a task board?

Visualize the flow of work so that we can improve it incrementally and organically--meaning no fixed framework. Just seeing your workflow helps you see the problems.

-   transparency -- visual representation of the team's workflow

-   iterative and incremental

-   helps define a "minimal workable product

-   problems with task "flow" are addressed as they arise

## GitHub project boards

Let's start a project board with GitHub!

- Create a board
- Make some issues
- Add issues to a board

## 30 minutes of co-work time

### Work on Pathways
- Ideas for things needed to move you towards a Pathway goals
- Identify some concrete tasks

### GitHub Project Boards
- Play around
- Raise hand or post in chat for help
- Mentors/helpers can go in a breakout room with you

Super ok to jump in an out of break out rooms to see what folks are talking about!
